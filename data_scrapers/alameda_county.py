We are showing data for each separately and together. The numbers for the Alameda County LHJ and the Berkeley LHJ come from the stateâ€™s communicable disease tracking database, CalREDIE. These data are updated daily, with cases sometimes reassigned to other LHJs and sometimes changed from a suspected to a confirmed case, so counts for a particular date in the past may change as information is updated in CalREDIE. Dates reflect the date created in CalREDIE. Furthermore, we review our data routinely and adjust to ensure its integrity and that it most accurately represents the full picture of COVID-19 cases in our county. The case rates likely reflect more the availability of testing than the actual disease burden. For instance, Hayward and places near Hayward have the highest case rates likely because of the availability of drive-through testing. Berkeley LHJ cases do not include two cases that were passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise.",
